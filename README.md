# ⚡ GODVIEW: THE OMNISCIENT DASHBOARD ⚡

> *"I see everything. Even that unsaved draft you just deleted."* — GodView AI

## 🚨 WARNING: DIVINE POWER INSIDE
Congratulations, mortal. You have stumbled upon **GodView**, the forbidden dashboard used by Cupid, Santa Claus, and the NSA (probably) to track human interactions across the globe.

By installing this module, you are effectively promoting yourself to **Assistant Regional Deity**. Use this power wisely. Or don't. I'm a README, not your mom.

---

## 👁️ What is this?
It's a dashboard. But not just *any* dashboard. It's a **Glassmorphic, Neon-glowing, Map-rendering, Data-crunching beast** that makes you look 10x cooler than you actual are.

- **See where love happens:** Real-time map tracking of "letters" (or whatever you want to track).
- **Feel the power:** Shake-to-reject login screen that visually judges people for wrong passwords.
- **Analyze the ether:** Stats cards that glow with the energy of a thousand suns (or just CSS gradients).

## 🛠️ How to Summon (Install)

1.  **Sacrifice** a small portion of your RAM to Chrome.
2.  **Chant** the following incantations in your `index.html`:
    ```html
    <!-- The ancient scrolls of Leaflet -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
    ```
3.  **Summon** the script:
    ```javascript
    import { GodView } from './src/godview.js';

    // Initiate God Mode
    const zeus = new GodView({
        containerId: 'mount-olympus', // Your div ID
        password: 'ambrosia',         // Keep it secret, keep it safe
        title: 'OLYMPUS CONTROL'
    });

    zeus.init();
    ```

## 🎮 Controls

- **Login:** Enter the password. If you get it wrong, the box will physically shake its head at you. It's very disappointed.
- **Map:** Drag the world around like the titan Atlas, but with a mouse.
- **Search:** Type anything. The search is faster than Hermes.
- **Export CSV:** Downloads a spreadsheet. Because even Gods need Excel sometimes.

## 🔮 The "Mock Data" Prophecy
If you don't provide real data, GodView will **hallucinate** an entire world of romance and drama for you. It will generate fake love letters between "Secret Admirer" and "Someone Special" in Tokyo, London, and Kochi.

It's like reality TV, but in code.

## 📜 Terms of Service
By using GodView, you agree to:
1. Not use this for evil (mild chaos is acceptable).
2. Admit that `border-radius: 16px` is superior to square corners.
3. Star this repo or bad luck will befall your git commits for 7 years.

*Built with ❤️, ☕, and too much CSS `box-shadow`.*
