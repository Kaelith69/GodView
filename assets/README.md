## demo.gif

Place a screen recording of GodView in action here as `demo.gif`.

The GIF should demonstrate:
1. The login screen with glassmorphic input box
2. A wrong password attempt triggering the shake animation
3. A successful login transitioning to the dashboard
4. The dark world map populating with glowing markers
5. Live search filtering the data cards
6. The CSV export button in action

**Tips:**
- Keep the file under 5 MB
- Record at 1x zoom — no need for oversized captures
- 10–20 seconds is plenty; loop cleanly
- Tools: LICEcap (Windows/Mac), peek (Linux), or any screen recorder that exports GIF/WebP
