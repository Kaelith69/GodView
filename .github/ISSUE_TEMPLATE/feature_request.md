name: ✨ Feature Request
about: Got an idea? The roadmap is mostly "thinking" items. Let's add yours.
title: "[FEATURE] "
labels: enhancement

<!-- Read the Roadmap first (wiki/Roadmap.md) — your idea might already be in the pipeline.
     Also read the "Won't Do" section. We won't do those things. They're listed for a reason.
     
     If your idea requires a framework, a backend, or IE11 support: respectfully, no. -->

## What problem does this solve?

<!-- Describe the gap. Not "it would be cool if" — tell us what you're actually trying to do
     and why the current module doesn't let you do it. -->

## Proposed solution

<!-- How would this work? Even rough pseudocode helps. -->

```javascript
// Example API sketch (optional but very helpful):
new GodView({
    containerId: 'app',
    // Your new thing here...
}).init();
```

## Alternatives considered

<!-- Did you try to work around this? How? What was wrong with the workaround? -->

## Why this belongs in GodView core

<!-- GodView's core principle is: zero runtime dependencies, browser-native, embeddable anywhere.
     Why does this feature fit that model rather than being a separate library or user-land code? -->

## Would you be willing to work on this?

- [ ] Yes, I'd like to submit a PR for this
- [ ] No, but I'm happy to test/review a PR
- [ ] Just the idea — I'll leave the building to you

## Additional context

<!-- Screenshots, mockups, links to similar implementations, etc. -->
